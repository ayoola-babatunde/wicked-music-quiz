# wicked-music-quiz

I wanted to make a quiz for a friend after watching Wicked (3 times!) and looping the soundtrack. I tried to use some other quiz platforms, but ended up learning basic website development. 

You get 1, 2, 3, and then 5 seconds of a chosen section of various songs from the movie soundtrack and try to guess it in as few tries as possible.
